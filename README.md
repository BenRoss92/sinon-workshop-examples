# Sinon.js Full-stack Workshop Examples

## What does it contain?

This repo contains runnable code examples showing how to use the Sandbox, Spy and Stub APIs in [Sinon.js](https://sinonjs.org/). It was used during parts 1 and 2 of the Sinon.js session for the [YouView ASG Full Stack Workshop](https://wiki.youview.co.uk/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=NEXTGENYV&title=Full+Stack+Workshop+-+Agendas+and+Materials).

## How to install the repo?

1. [Install Node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm), e.g. by using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). N.B. Install a Node version of 8 or higher - this is due to the `async`/`await` keywords not being supported in lower versions.
2. Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/BenRoss92/sinon-workshop-examples) by running: `git clone git@github.com:BenRoss92/sinon-workshop-examples.git` 
3. Change into the directory by running: `cd sinon-workshop-examples`.
4. Install the dependencies by running: `npm install`.

## How do I run the examples?

To run all of the test files in the `test/` directory, run: `npm test`.

To run all of the test files in the `test/` directory, as well as rerunning the tests whenever changes are made to either the `test/` or `src/` directories, run: `npm run test:watch`.

## Where are the slides of the workshop session? Was there a recording of the session?

The slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1La3z-wvTVUSncNVAeWPXB1KkPqb62_by1OZSYWF_Mxc/edit?usp=sharing) - please see the 'Useful resources' slide for links to further guides. Please also note that the slides were purposely left minimal.

This may not be accessible as there is an issue with Sharepoint permissions at the moment that hopefully should get resolved at some point in the future?
