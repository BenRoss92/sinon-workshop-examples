# Sinon.js Full-stack Workshop Examples

## What does it contain?

This repo contains runnable code examples showing how to use the Sandbox, Spy and Stub APIs in [Sinon.js](https://sinonjs.org/). It was used during parts 1 and 2 of the Sinon.js session for the [YouView ASG Full Stack Workshop](https://wiki.youview.co.uk/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=NEXTGENYV&title=Full+Stack+Workshop+-+Agendas+and+Materials).

## How to install the repo?

1. [Install Node and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm), e.g. by using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). N.B. Install a Node version of 8 or higher - this is due to the `async`/`await` keywords not being supported in lower versions.
2. Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/BenRoss92/sinon-workshop-examples) by running: `git clone git@github.com:BenRoss92/sinon-workshop-examples.git` 
3. Change into the directory by running: `cd sinon-workshop-examples`.
4. Install the dependencies by running: `npm install`.

## How do I run the examples?

To run all of the test files in the `test/` directory, run: `npm test`.

To run all of the test files in the `test/` directory, as well as rerunning the tests whenever changes are made to either the `test/` or `src/` directories, run: `npm run test:watch`.
