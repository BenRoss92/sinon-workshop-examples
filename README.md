# Sinon.js Full-stack Workshop Examples

## What does it contain?

This repo contains runnable code examples showing how to use the Sandbox, Spy and Stub APIs in Sinon.js. It was used during parts 1 and 2 of the [YouView ASG Full-stack Workshop](https://wiki.youview.co.uk/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=NEXTGENYV&title=Full+Stack+Workshop+-+Agendas+and+Materials) session on [Sinon.js](https://sinonjs.org/).

## How to install the repo?

1. Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/BenRoss92/sinon-workshop-examples) and `cd` into it.
2. Install Node (minimum version 8 as `async`/`await` keywords must be supported in your version) and npm locally if you don't have them installed already.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.

## How do I run the examples?

To run all of the test files in the `test/` directory, run `npm test`.

To run all of the test files in the `test/` directory and rerun whenever changes are made to either the `test/` or `src/` directories, run `npm run test:watch`.
